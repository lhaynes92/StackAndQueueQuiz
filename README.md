# Coding Questions:

### Queue toString

Copy in your `Node` and `Queue` classes and add the following method to `Queue`:

```java
//prints all the elements of the Queue class in order from front to back
public String toString()

```
You may also want to write a driver to test the toString method.

### Queue Functions

Complete the class `QueueFunctions.java` by implementing the following methods:

```java
//removes all elements with data matching the target (assume your objects have a good .equals)
public static void removeAll(Queue q, Object target)

//reverses the order of the elements in the Queue q
public static void reverseQueue(Queue q) 

//driver to test removeAll and reverseQueue
//use good print statements: print expected result of test, print actual result of test
public static void main(String[] args)
```
